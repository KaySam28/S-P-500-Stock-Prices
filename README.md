## Objective <a name="objective"></a>

The purpose of this analysis is to explore a dataset of Airbnb in Berlin with particular regard to the differences between the former East and West: 
1. Which date in the sample saw the largest overall trading volume? On that date, which two stocks were traded most?

2. _On which day of the week does volume tend to be highest? Lowest?

3.  _On which date did Amazon (AMZN) see the most volatility, measured by the difference between the high and low price?

If I could go back in time and invest in one stock from 1/2/2014 - 12/29/2017, which would one I  choose? What % gain would I gain?
